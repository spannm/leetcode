## Java Solutions to LeetCode Problems

In this repo you will find a collection of hundreds of Java solutions to [LeetCode coding problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/).

I was active on LeetCode for quite some time,<br>
peaking in a 500-day streak of solving the daily challenge,<br>
and even earning a free T-Shirt (which turned out too small and could not be exchanged :)

This project requires Maven and Java 17.<br>

It has neither compile nor run-time, only test dependencies.<br>
Unit tests are based on JUnit 5 and *@ParameterizedTest*.<br>

Most solutions have been successfully submitted.<br>
Many come with JUnit tests using test data found in the problem descriptions.<br>

Solutions are named *ProblemNNNN*, tests are named *ProblemNNNNTest*,<br>
where *NNNN* is the problem number formatted to four digits with leading zeroes.<br>

To build the project simply type: `mvn` (defaults to `mvn clean verify`)<br>

- Use as you wish and as you see fit.<br>

- No warranty given.<br>

- No need to give credit.<br>

- Hope you'll find it useful.<br>

### Happy coding!
